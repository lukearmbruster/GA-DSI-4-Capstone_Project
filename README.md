# GA-DSI-4-Capstone_Project

January 24, 2017

Goals:

1. Articulate specific aim

  My aim in this project is to identify what factors contribute to high user engagement as measured by
  Facebook reactions among mainstream and fake news sources. Once the factors are idenfitied, build a model
  that predicts whether a news source is fake or mainstream, and build another model that determins which topics are likely to 
  be most popular. 

2. Outline proposed methods and models

  -Via the Facebook Graph API, download post features of fake and mainstream news sources as identified by published sources. 
   Desired post features include id, message, link name, post type (i.e. event, link, photo, status, video), post link,
   date published, count of reactions (sum of counts that follow), count of comments, count of shares, count of likes, count      of loves, count of wows, count of hahas, count of sads, and count of angrys. 
  
  -Download post features approximately two months before and after the U.S. presidential election to evaluate the effect of a 
   major political event on news coverage. 
   
  -Determine the count of posts, reactions to posts, and n-grams in post messages and link names for fake and mainstream          news. 
   
  -Build supervised models with interpretable feature effects (e.g. linear, logistic regression). 

3. Define risks and assumptions

  -Fake and mainstream news sources may not be representative of all mainstream and fake news sources
  
  -Fake news
