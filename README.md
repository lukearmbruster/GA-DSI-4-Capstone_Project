January 24, 2017

Goals:

1. articulate specific aim

My aim in this project is to identify what factors contribute to high user engagement as measured by
Facebook reactions among mainstream and fake news sources. Once the factors are idenfitied, build a model
that predicts whether a news source is fake or mainstream. 

2. outline proposed methods and models

3. define risks and assumptions

4. revise initial goals & success criteria

5. create local database

6. Describe data cleaning/munging techniques

7. Create a data dictionary

8. Perform & summarize EDA
