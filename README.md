Goals:

1. Articulate specific aim

  My aim in this project is to identify what factors contribute to high user engagement as measured by
  Facebook reactions among mainstream and fake news sources. Once the factors are idenfitied, build a model
  that predicts whether a news source is fake or mainstream. 

2. outline proposed methods and models

3. define risks and assumptions

4. revise initial goals & success criteria

5. create local database

6. Describe data cleaning/munging techniques

7. Create a data dictionary

8. Perform & summarize EDA
